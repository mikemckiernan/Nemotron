# 📄 Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) with Nemotron RAG

Build a production-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) pipeline that transforms complex enterprise documents—containing dense text, charts, and tables—into a queryable knowledge base using NVIDIA Nemotron models.

## 📋 Overview

Standard text extraction often fails on complex enterprise documents due to "Linearization Loss"—the loss of structural context. This example demonstrates how to solve this using **NVIDIA NeMo Retriever** and **multimodal Nemotron models**.

The pipeline handles:
1.  **Complex Layouts**: Preserves structure in financial reports and manuals.
2.  **Visual Data**: Extracts and understands trends in charts (e.g., bar graphs).
3.  **Dense Tables**: Maintains row/column alignment for accurate financial lookups.

## 📦 Models Used

| Component | Model | Function | Deployment |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Extraction** | `NeMo Retriever Library (nv-ingest)` | A library for advanced document parsing | Self-hosted (Library Mode) |
| **Embedding** | `nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2` | Multimodal Embedding (Text + Images) | Local Inference (Hugging Face) |
| **Reranking** | `nvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2` | Visual Cross-Encoder Reranking | Local Inference (Hugging Face) |
| **Reasoning** | `nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b` | Citation-Backed Answer Generation | NVIDIA NIM / API |

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multimodal RAG**: Retrieves and reasons over both text and visual elements (charts/graphs).
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Uses YOLOX and Transformer-based models to detect and crop charts and parse tables into Markdown.
- **Visual Reranking**: The reranker "sees" the retrieved chart images to verify relevance, improving accuracy over text-only search.
- **Hardware-Aware**: Includes robust fallback mechanisms to run on varying GPU architectures (e.g., T4 vs. H100) by adjusting precision and attention implementations automatically.
- **Citation & Verification**: Enforces strict citation of sources and internal fact-checking (reasoning traces) to reduce hallucinations.

## 🔧 Requirements

### Hardware
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU recommended: H100 (Tested on H100 and T4).
  - *Note*: The notebook includes patches to support older GPUs (like T4) by disabling Flash Attention 2 where incompatible.

### Software
- Python 3.12
- **NVIDIA API Key**: Required for the Generation NIM (`llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b`).
- **Dependencies**: `nv-ingest`, `pymilvus`, `pillow`, `transformer`, etc.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Environment
Install the required libraries. Note that `nv-ingest` is used in **Library Mode** for this example, which runs locally without requiring a complex Docker setup.

```bash
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```
### 2. Configure API Key
Export your NVIDIA API key to access the cloud-hosted generation models.

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="nvapi-..."
```
### 3. Run the Notebook
Launch Jupyter and run the pipeline:

```bash
jupyter notebook intelligent_document_processing_pipeline.ipynb
```
