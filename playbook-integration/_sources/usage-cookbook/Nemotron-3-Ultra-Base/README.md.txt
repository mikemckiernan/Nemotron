# **NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra — Base Model**

**Announced at GTC San Jose 2026** · Best Open Base Model

Nemotron 3 Ultra is NVIDIA's largest open model: **550B total parameters with up to 55B active per token** via a hybrid Mamba-Transformer mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture.

Similar to Nemotron 3 Super, it was pre-trained using NVFP4 and shares the same core technical innovations:

* **LatentMoE** — Compresses tokens into a low-rank latent space before routing, enabling 4× as many expert specialists for the same inference cost.
* **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)** — Predicts multiple future tokens in a single forward pass, improving chain-of-thought coherence and enabling built-in speculative decoding at inference time.
* **1M Token Context Length** — Mamba-2 layers provide linear-time complexity over sequence length, making 1M-token context practical for long-document and agentic workloads.

Nemotron 3 Ultra is a **pre-training base checkpoint** — it has not undergone instruction tuning or post-training alignment. This means it is not meant to be used out of the box as an assistant or in a production pipeline.

It is designed to be the best possible **starting point for customization**: fine-tuning on domain data, reinforcement learning post-training, and custom instruction tuning pipelines. If you're looking for a model you can deploy directly, wait for the post-trained release.
